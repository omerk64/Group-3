# Group-3 Flight delays    https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays


According to the U.S Department of Transportation’s Air Travel Consumer Report released on February 18, 2016, DOT’s Aviation Consumer Protection Division received 20,170 airline consumer complaints in 2015, an increase of 29.8 percent from the 15,539 complaints received in 2014. In December 2015, the Department received 1,565 complaints about airline service from consumers, compared to 1,065 filed in December 2014, and 1,308 received in November 2015, which is a 46.9 percent increase from the same month in 2014 and a 19.6 percent increase from November 2015. These complaints cover a wide range of aviation service issues which includes flight delays, baggage, reservations, refunds, consumer service, disability, and discrimination. 


Goals of Our Project:

Given the  information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, our goal is to analyze the dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations to determine which operating carriers report the highest on-time performance rate. Additionally, our study aims to examine the causes of delays and cancellations for each airline. Users of our program can compare the overall delay and cancellation records of each airline to determine which airlines provided the best service. The dataset contains 14 airlines or carriers with their reported numbers.The dataset also covers non-stop scheduled-service flights between 322 airports within the United States. 


The dataset “2015 flight delays and cancelations” is a CSV file that summarizes information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights, published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report. 
The data was taken from 14 carriers/airlines that reported their performance and numbers in 2015. 
The data covers non stop scheduled-service flights between 322 airports within the United States. 

Descriptive Analytics 

We will begin with descriptive analytics to answer the question “What has happened?“ with flight delays in 2015. After cleaning the dataset, we will use data visualization to showcase the trend of average delay in minutes for each of the airports and airlines per day or month. In addition, we will map which airports are the busiest and at which time of the year. We will showcase which airline has the most flights and which region they cover. 

 Multiple regression model  
 
We will study how departure delay is affected by the independent variables such as wind, tempearture, humidity and pressure. For the departure time we want to see if there is a relationship between dweather and departure delay. For example, flights in the winter might have higher departure delay or the other way around. Even though a flight might have a departure delay, it could make up the time during the flight and still arrive on time. So, it will be interesting to study if there is a relationship between them.
